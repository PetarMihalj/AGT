Flattening:

Goals:
    - to simplify further type deduction by introducing a set of simple IR instructions
    - should still capture the notion of a template / function / struct

    Level 1 constructs:
        - Function definition
        - Struct definition
    Both level 1 constructs can be parametrized (thus, they are templates). 

    Level 2 constructs:
        -
